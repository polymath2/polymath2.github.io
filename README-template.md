## Overview

### Screenshot

![](images/Screenshot-challenge.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
// it took me a while to get started with the challenge since i got other things going on.
// when i started building it took me only an hour to organise my files and write my css/
// i started by creating making the div with the class container a flex so i could center it. i also had to work on the text to align it just as the desktop template.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

i had issues aligning my text, and images i had to use the internet to get css properties that could do that.
